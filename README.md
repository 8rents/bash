## Using the correct branch

This repository has a different branch for each different platform type (windows, etc) in addition to the standard `info` branch. **Make sure to select the correct branch to get started.**

### Using the command line to list and change branches

```bash
# EXAMPLE: checking out the windows branch
# ----------------------------------------

# List all the branches
git branch -v -a

# Switch to windows branch (-c creates local branch)
git switch -c windows
```
